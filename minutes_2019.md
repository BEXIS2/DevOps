## Past

### 2019-06-27

**Time**: 13:10 - 14:05
**Venue**: KaffeekÃ¼che
**Attendees**: David, Eleonora, Hamdi, Martin, Sven

**Topic**: Instance Presentations

* iDiv
  * bexis2 version: 2.12.0 (2x)
  * postgresql : 9.3
  * server: windows server 2012r2
  * modifications:
    * home -> redirect to different page
      * better would be a load of external module page, so that it is not removed after update
    * menu -> chnages in the manifest files
    * dataset upload:
      * normal workflow only for unstructured
      * easy upload for tabular data only
    * extension of dim with new workflow to publish datasets
      * so it could be cumbersome at update time
      * publish to GBIF
        * mapping to DcA necessary - more system specific, because the upload restricts the user to take only DcA attributes
        * all of this stuff is inside DIM
      * get DOI via second workflow
        * maybe consider it as a separate module? or should it be part of the core in the long run?
    * requests available in different spots
    * modifications inside help section
  * modules:
    * iDiv module for different content within the website
      * good approach, so no changes after update
    * multi media modul
      * extension for visualization of documents within bexis2 core
      * map view doesn't work anymore, because of structural changes
      * polygones with images and further information as zip-file
      * extensible?

* provenance of changes?
  * how and what to change on update?
  * documentation needed
    * up to now, not enough!
