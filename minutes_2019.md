    * migration of feature permissions still open
  * EMM (event management module)
    * planning of events, meetings, retreats, etc.
    * available for anonymous users (secured with password)
    * XML based event form (using metadata entity)
    * small issues (e.g. "create dataset" and not "create event/register")
  * FMT (file management tool)
    * management of different types of data (internal documents)
      * several security issues for different file types
      * controller with specific scope on "normal" users and "administrators"
  * LUI (landuse information)
    * calculation based on dataset(s)
    * parameter selection based on form (based on config file)

## Past

### 2019-07-04

**Time**: 13:15 - 14:10
**Venue**: Telco
**Attendees**: Eleonora, Hamdi, Martin, Sven

**Topic(s)**: Instance Presentations

* open issues from last meeting?

* AquaDiva
  * in general problems with materialized views for large datasets
    * visualization of ONLY indexed datasets (different from core implementation)
  * modification of search interface (especially for facets)
    * redure redundancies (e.g. owner names - only "Kai Totsche", and not "Kai", "Totsche" and "Kai Totsche")
    * needs modifications in the search config files for "how to index and compose nodes"
    * still some minor issues with handling of values in different metadata schemas
    * potential improvement(s): offer the possibility to create rules for "merging"
  * dataset annotations
    * embedded into the easy upload
    * suggestions (e.g. similar to unit)
  * statistics
    * how many datasets, data-points, and so on...
  * resource booking management
    * rights management should applied beforehand
    * workflow: request -> decision -> confirmation
    * additional step in the "wizard"
    * additional settings file (similar to credentials.config)
    * this modified feature is not used (even though this was a high prioritized function)
  * dataset summary
    * python/R scripts 
    * big data seems to be an issue - long loading time
  * more visual relationship graphs with "a priori" algorithms
    * still some issues with those identifications

### 2019-06-27

**Time**: 13:10 - 14:05
**Venue**: KaffeekÃ¼che
**Attendees**: David, Eleonora, Hamdi, Martin, Sven

**Topic(s)**: Instance Presentations

* iDiv
  * bexis2 version: 2.12.0 (2x)
  * postgresql : 9.3
  * server: windows server 2012r2
  * modifications:
    * home -> redirect to different page
      * better would be a load of external module page, so that it is not removed after update
    * menu -> chnages in the manifest files
    * dataset upload:
      * normal workflow only for unstructured
      * easy upload for tabular data only
    * extension of dim with new workflow to publish datasets
      * so it could be cumbersome at update time
      * publish to GBIF
        * mapping to DcA necessary - more system specific, because the upload restricts the user to take only DcA attributes
        * all of this stuff is inside DIM
      * get DOI via second workflow
        * maybe consider it as a separate module? or should it be part of the core in the long run?
    * requests available in different spots
    * modifications inside help section
  * modules:
    * iDiv module for different content within the website
      * good approach, so no changes after update
    * multi media modul
      * extension for visualization of documents within bexis2 core
      * map view doesn't work anymore, because of structural changes
      * polygones with images and further information as zip-file
      * extensible?

* provenance of changes?
  * how and what to change on update?
  * documentation needed
    * up to now, not enough!
